![An icon for the add-on](images/PackIcon.png)

#### Keen's Custom Recipe X

An add-on that let's you craft an item that was ONLY OBTAINABLE in Creative Mode, using `/give` command, and an item that was lost to history (cannot obtainable with Creative Mode & `/give` command).

This add-on let's you flex, or trap the heck outta your friends.

BUT, there is still an unobtainable block/an undestructible block YOU cannot place/cannot break on Survival Mode. So, make sure to be careful, or just flex to your friends.
